# ðŸŒ± Sprout CLI Config Repository

This repository is used to store configuration files for my setup. I use it along with the `sprout` CLI to manage my development environment when I set up a new machine or need to reconfigure an existing one.

The [`sprout`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@shrubs/sprout) CLI allows you to pull configuration files from a remote repository and apply them to your local machine.
